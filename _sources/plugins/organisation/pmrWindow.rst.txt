==================
 PMRWindow plugin
==================

The PMRWindow plugin offers an interface to `PMR <https://models.physiomeproject.org/>`__.
By default, it lists all the published exposures found in `PMR <https://models.physiomeproject.org/>`__:

.. image:: pics/PMRWindowScreenshot01.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 25%

The list can be filtered.
For example, to enter ``Noble`` as a filter gives:

.. image:: pics/PMRWindowScreenshot02.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 25%

You can right click on any of the exposures to view them in `PMR <https://models.physiomeproject.org/>`__, copy their `URL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL>`__ to the clipboard, or make a local copy of them (see the :ref:`PMR Workspaces window <plugins_organisation_pmrWorkspacesWindow>` for the latter).
Alternatively, double click on any of the exposures to reveal their contents.
For example, to double click on ``Noble, 1962`` gives:

.. image:: pics/PMRWindowScreenshot03.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 25%

From there, double click on either ``noble_1962.cellml`` or ``noble_1962.sedml`` to open them in OpenCOR.
You can also right click on any of them to view them in `PMR <https://models.physiomeproject.org/>`__ or copy their `URL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL>`__ to the clipboard.
